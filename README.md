# Optimization_Simplex

The simplex method is a technique for solving problems in linear programming, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with optimizing a linear function subject to a set of linear constraints. Linear programming has many applications in fields such as economics, engineering, operations research, and computer science.
The simplex method works by finding the best solution among the vertices of a geometric figure called a polytope, which is defined by linear constraints. The method starts from an initial vertex and moves along the edges of the polytope until it reaches the optimal vertex, where the linear function has the maximum or minimum value. The method uses algebraic rules to determine which vertex to move to next and when to stop.
